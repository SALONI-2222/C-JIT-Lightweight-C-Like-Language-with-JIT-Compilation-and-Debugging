Lexer: Tokenizes input source code (from lexer.c/h).  Parser: Builds an AST from tokens using a recursive-descent parser (parser.c/h).  IR Generator: Converts AST to a 3-address code-style intermediate representation (ir.c/h).  Optimizer: Performs constant folding and IR-level simplifications (optimizer.c/h).
